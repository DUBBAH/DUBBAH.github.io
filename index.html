        <h1> What is DUBBAH? </h1>
        <p>  A project which focuses on developing publicly available machine learning algorithms that can
            assist providers in the management of the process of loaning medical aids.<br><br>

            The objectives are:
            <ol>
              <li> An algorithm capable of estimating a timeline of the progession in medical aids for any citizen. This include estimating the time in between loans, identify unnecessary medical aids loaned and estimate the probability the citizen will need more medical aids in the future.</li>
              <li> An algorithm capable of identifying the probability that physical exercise would benefit the citizen.</li>
              <li> Find typical patterns in the usage of medical aids and benifit of physical exercise. </li>
              <li> The software should have a well defined and simple interface. </li>
            </ol>

            The project is a partnership between Aarhus Unviersity, Kommunernes Landsforening,
            Aalborg Kommune, Aarhus Kommune, University College Nordjylland, and DigiRehab A/S.

            The software development runs from December 2018 to May 2019 and takes place at
            Aarhus Universty. The following 6 months contain integration and pilot testing in Aalborg Kommune.<br><br>


        <!--With emphasis on:

        Demonstration of data driven decision support
        Visualisation of loan plans
        Production of open source software libraries-->

        <h1> Background for DUBBAH </h1>

        <h3> The Danish Social Security Administration and Fredericia Municipality </h3>
          <p>The Danish Social Security Administration has formerly investigated the effects of early rehabilition in the proces of loaning medical aids.
           In a project called "Tidlige Rehabiliterende Indsats (TRI)", which can be downloaded <a href = "https://www.fredericia.dk/system/files/cp-documents/d5f9da0b-efa8-e611-80cc-005056b95f67.pdf "> here </a>,
           they found different patterns in the medical aids loans depending on what a cityzen applyid for in the beggining.
          They also found that any improvement regarding self capacity and physical capacity gained as an effect of medical aids or exercise varied depending on age and the baseline.
          <!--Those who had the most dificulties had the most benefit of medical aids. This was a IPPA-scale (Individually Prioritised Problems Assessment) -->
