        <h1> What is DUBBAH? </h1>
        <p> DUBBAH is an abbrevation of <i>Digital Understøttet Bedre Brug Af Hjælpmidler</i> which can be translated to <i>digital supported better usage of medical aids</i>.

          It is a project funded by Kommunernes Landsforening which focuses on developing publicly available machine learning algorithms that can
          assist providers in the management of loaning medical aids.<br><br>

            The objectives are:

            <ol>
              <li> An algorithm capable of estimating a timeline of the progession in medical aids for any citizen. This include estimating the time in between loans, identify unnecessary medical aids loaned and estimate the probability the citizen will need more medical aids in the future.</li>
              <li> An algorithm capable of identifying the probability that physical exercise would benefit the citizen.</li>
              <li> Find typical patterns in the usage of medical aids and benifit of physical exercise. </li>
              <li> The software should have a well defined and simple interface. </li>
            </ol>

            The project is a partnership between Aarhus Unviersity, Kommunernes Landsforening,
            Aalborg Kommune, Aarhus Kommune, University College Nordjylland, and DigiRehab A/S.

            The project runs from April 2018 to October 2019 in 3 overall phases. The first 6 months is a startup phase including datacollection in Aalborg Kommune.
            The following 6 months contains software development at Aarhus University. The last 6 months contain integration and pilot testing in Aalborg Kommune.<br><br>


        <!--With emphasis on:

        Demonstration of data driven decision support
        Visualisation of loan plans
        Production of open source software libraries-->

        <h1> Background for DUBBAH </h1>

        <h3> The Danish Social Security Administration and Fredericia Municipality </h3>
          <p>The Danish Social Security Administration has formerly investigated the effects of early rehabilition in the proces of loaning medical aids.
           In a project called "Tidlige Rehabiliterende Indsats (TRI)", which can be downloaded <a href = "https://www.fredericia.dk/system/files/cp-documents/d5f9da0b-efa8-e611-80cc-005056b95f67.pdf ">here</a>,
           they found different patterns in the medical aids loans depending on what a cityzen applyid for in the beggining.
          They also found that any improvement regarding self capacity and physical capacity gained as an effect of medical aids or exercise varied depending on age and the baseline.
          <!--Those who had the most dificulties had the most benefit of medical aids. This was a IPPA-scale (Individually Prioritised Problems Assessment) -->
          </p>

          <h3> Danish Municipalities'  Common Program for Health Technology</h3>
          The program for healtcare technology was founded by the municipalities in Denmark. The objective were to ensure a strategical developement of healthcare
          tehcnology such as how to promote sharing of knowledge, coordination, common documentation and implementation of new healthcare technology.
          You can read more about the program <a href = "https://docplayer.dk/51850468-Programbeskrivelse-2-1-program-for-velfaerdsteknologi-formaal-og-baggrund.html">here</a>.
          In the status report from 2017, which can be accessed <a href = "http://www.kl.dk/ImageVaultFiles/id_85096/cf_202/Statusrapport_p-_digitalt_underst-ttet_tr-ning_og_.PDF ">here</a>,
          it can be seen that "better usage of medical aids" was rated among the top 5 health tech contributers in the past and in the future.
          They define better usage as ways to promote collaboration and effictivity in between, occupational therapist, physical theprapist, nurses and the citizen
          Furthermore, the program focuses on healthcare technology for mobility that can rehablitate citizen, maintain or promote self capacitity in 2018.
