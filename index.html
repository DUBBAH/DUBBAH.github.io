        <h1> What is DUBBAH? </h1>
        <p> DUBBAH is an acronym for <i>Digital Understøttet Bedre Brug Af Hjælpmidler</i> which can be translated to <i>digital supported better usage of assistive technology</i>.

          It is a project funded by Kommunernes Landsforening which focuses on developing publicly available machine learning algorithms that can
          assist providers in the management of loaning assistive technology.<br><br>

          The objectives are:

          <ol>
            <li> An algorithm capable of estimating a timeline of the progession in assistive technology for any citizen. This include estimating the time in between loans, identify unnecessary assistive technology loaned and estimate the probability the citizen will need more assistive technology in the future.</li>
            <li> An algorithm capable of identifying the probability that physical exercise would benefit the citizen.</li>
            <li> Find typical patterns in the usage of assistive technology and benifit of physical exercise. </li>
            <li> The software should have a well defined and simple interface. </li>
          </ol>

          The project is a partnership between Aarhus Unviersity, Kommunernes Landsforening,
          Aalborg Kommune, Aarhus Kommune, University College Nordjylland, and DigiRehab A/S.

          The project scheduled to run from April 2018 to October 2019 in 3 overall phases. The first 6 months is a startup phase including data collection in Aalborg Kommune.
          The following 6 months contains software development at Aarhus University. The last 6 months contain integration and pilot testing in Aalborg Kommune.<br><br>

        <h1> Background for DUBBAH </h1>

        <h4> The Danish Social Security Administration and Fredericia Municipality </h4>
          <p>The Danish Social Security Administration has formerly investigated the effects of early rehabilition in the proces of loaning assistive technology.
           In a project called "Tidlige Rehabiliterende Indsats (TRI)", which can be downloaded <a href = "https://www.fredericia.dk/system/files/cp-documents/d5f9da0b-efa8-e611-80cc-005056b95f67.pdf ">here</a>,
           they found different patterns in the assistive technology loans depending on what a citizen applyid for in the beggining.
          They also found that any improvement regarding self capacity and physical capacity gained as an effect of assistive technology or exercise varied depending on age and the baseline.
          <!--Those who had the most dificulties had the most benefit of assistive technology. This was a IPPA-scale (Individually Prioritised Problems Assessment) -->
          </p>

          <h4> Danish Municipalities'  Common Program for Health Technology</h4>
            <p>
            The program for healtcare technology was founded by the municipalities in Denmark. The objective were to ensure a strategical developement of healthcare
            tehcnology such as how to promote sharing of knowledge, coordination, common documentation and implementation of new healthcare technology.
            You can read more about the program <a href = "https://docplayer.dk/51850468-Programbeskrivelse-2-1-program-for-velfaerdsteknologi-formaal-og-baggrund.html">here</a>.
            In the status report from 2017, which can be accessed <a href = "http://www.kl.dk/ImageVaultFiles/id_85096/cf_202/Statusrapport_p-_digitalt_underst-ttet_tr-ning_og_.PDF ">here</a>,
            it can be seen that "better usage of assistive technology" was rated among the top 5 health tech contributers in the past and in the future.
            They define better usage as ways to promote collaboration and effictivity in between, occupational therapist, physical theprapist, nurses and the citizen.
            Furthermore, the program focuses in 2018 on healthcare technology for mobility that can rehabilitate, maintain or promote self capacitity in the citizen.
            </p>

          <h4> The Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Healthcare </h4>
            <p>
            The potential benefits of artifical intelligence within healthcare are often discussed in novel science and research literature.
            Some of the hopes are that technology can help overcome future demographic challenges by being applied in a broad range of fields such as cardiology, radiology and much more (<a href = "https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5910">Zhang 2018</A>).
            As an example apple recently published the new generation of Apple watch which is capable of detecting ateria fibrillation.
            One of the huge benefits of medical data is the size. In 2020 medical health records are predicted to generate 25000 petabytes of data (<a href = "https://www.ghdonline.org/uploads/big-data-in-healthcare_B_Kaplan_2012.pdf">Feldman 2012</A>).
            In a review form 2016 the challenges and oppertunities of big data were discussed. Some of the drawbacks identified were data quality, data security, privacy, interoperability etc. (<a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27872036">Toldo 2016</A>).
            A solution to this could be making machine learning projects interdisciplinary (what we strive for in DUBBAH), as was proposed in a recent review investigating how digital healthcare can be used within epidemiology (<a href = "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7E75932DBC6A5935F0B5E0A2DAC0A1A6/S0899823X18002659a.pdf/introduction_to_machine_learning_in_digital_healthcare_epidemiology.pdf">Widmer 2018</A>).
            </p>

          <h4> Anonymized Authentic Case Story of Mr.Jensen </h4>
            <p>
              The following case story is authentic and taken from Aalborg Municipality. In order too keep it anonymous the patient is called "Mr.Jensen".<br><br>

              In 2006 was "Mr. Jensen" loaned a Induction loop.
              In October 2014, he was granted a stronger doorbell with puzzle call.
              In November 2014, he was given an outdoor rollator and a month after that a rail for self-lifting.
              In May 2015, an indoor rollator and two months later, he gets a shower stool and a GSM emergency call, if he falls over.
              At the beginning of 2018 he gets the doorsteps removed in his home. <br><br>



              Looking at Mr.Jensen's self-reliance it is clear that it has a negative development.
              The rate of which assistive technologies are granted is increasing from November and onwards.
              A timeline of this might look like this
              <div class = "crop">
                <img src="images/AssitiveTechnologyDevelopmentCONV.png" alt = "Timeline for conventional development of Assistive Technology needed" >
              </div>

              If a system could detect an unnormal development in loans of assitive technology or suggest a preventive rehabilition program there is a chance that Mr.Jensen would not need that much help.
              This would which would yield an alternative timeline:

                <img src="images/AssitiveTechnologyDevelopmentNEW.png" alt = "Timeline for new development of Assistive Technology needed" >

          </p>

        <h3>"Artificial Intelligence can make Rehabilitaion Twice as Effective"</h3>
          The 6th of December 2018 municipal health published an <a href = "https://kommunalsundhed.dk/kunstig-intelligens-kan-goere-genoptraening-dobbelt-saa-effektivt-i-kommunerne/">article</a> about the results of phase one and future plans of the project.

        <h1> The Results of The Project </h1>
          <p>
            This section will be updated continously as new results are discovered.
          </p>

        <h3>Preliminary Results </h3>
          <p>
            Evaluated by self-reliance the mean increase from physical exercise was 14%.
            Comparing this outcome based on the usage of assistive technologies,
            citizens using rollators achieved the highest increase at 29% and citizens using tuning system the lowest at 13 % as seen in the bar chart below.
